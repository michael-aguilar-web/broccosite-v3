# weeb hype

## definition

A "weeb hyped" piece of media is something that is overhyped, which is amplified by the fact that a lot of weebs only watch anime and nothing else, therefore biasing their scale of what's actually good and what isn't

## examples

things that are weeb hyped:
- SAO
- Dragon Ball
- My Hero Academia
- Your Name

things that are actually good:
- One Piece
- Persona 5
