# boomeritis

*note: after writing this I realized this is high key just a depressed diary entry but I haven't written anything in a while so idc (and it is past 12pm so my decision inhibitors are disabled)*

#### sometimes I think about how funny past me was for saying stuff like:

> oh I'll never get tired of osu, I'm going to keep playing this game until I'm 30! (that being said why are there not many older people that play the game huh I wonder why that could possibly be the case)

maybe it's just burnout from games in general but I don't really feel that fire to grind and prove myself anymore

maybe once tft set 9 rolls around that passion will come back but currently I keep distracting myself with random projects that have slightly more potential

maybe I just value my time differently now and using my 4-5 daily hours of free time during a weekday just doesn't feel right if I end up going net negative LP

in reality it's probably just the fact that I've spent enough time behind a screen that I'm subconsiously seeking new experiences, but my body still hates the outdoors with a passion so that makes things slightly more annoying than it should be

#### it's also funny how some things are inevitable about getting older:

not that I'm that old in the grand scheme of things, but i've definitely amassed enough perspective from post-college adulting to know what's ahead - in particular that one tweet I made about time dilation wasn't really a joke

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">first day of my first real job today aka exchanging my mechanical fps skill for a salary<br><br>can&#39;t wait to blink and be suddenly 40 years old, married and have kids</p>&mdash; Broccoli (@Broccoccoccoli) <a href="https://twitter.com/Broccoccoccoli/status/1587049338684907520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

working a 9-5 really does suck the soul out of you if you don't enjoy it, I'm currently living that every day of the week - I originally thought that if you had enough money you could get through it but I don't think that's the case (unless you're in a situation where you're barely getting by and working to feed your starving kids is what motivates you, but I'm assuming if you're reading this, then that probably isn't your situation)

I'm currently going through a feedback loop of doom in which work mentally destroys me to the point where I'm struggling to work on the projects I actually want to work on at home - especially since frc is over now, I can't really force myself to work on something productive as easily

but at the same time if I don't do something measureable by the end of the day, it feels incredibly doomed that I accomplished nothing

hopefully one of these job apps that I'm sending into what seems like an endless void eventually hits something and I will be saved, but until then it feels like the days are flying by at a pace I don't enjoy

but hey, it is what it is, it definitely could be way worse and I'm fortunate for that at least
