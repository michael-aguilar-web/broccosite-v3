# the stages of tft

having made the ranked climb on various accounts across multiple sets, this is a generalization of what skills I think a player in a given tier is lacking in order to be able to climb


> note: the text under each rank describes the skills you need to master to climb out of that rank

## iron

**basic checkboxes, do you have ___?**

## bronze

**understanding basic tft mechanics**
- econ
- basic positioning: understanding range, melee vs ranged carries


## silver

**learning the set (aka actually starting to read what everything does)**
- champion traits
- champion abilities
- items and basic BiS itemization: don't need to be proficient, just need to understand the idea of BiS


## gold

**understanding how to play 1-3 lines**
- having a plan for your opener --> midgame --> endgame
- understanding the [[2-3-rule|2/3 rule]]: aka what makes a 2-1 spot good/bad/ok


## plat/diamond

**becoming more proficient in fundamentals**

**understanding how to read the lobby**
- what comp to play: scouting free lines

## master

**knowing every line**

&nbsp;


**mastering fundamentals**
- never blundering econ / positioning / slamming / etc


## gm

(personally never played enough to climb out of gm before but I have an idea based on watching pros)


**reading the patch and understanding the spectrums of tft**
- forcing vs playing the given line based on early direction
- strongest board playing for hp and high tempo vs playing for guaranteed econ
- slamming early vs greeding for BiS
- when to stop rolling down to stabilize


these spectrums are patch dependent and the mastery of this is what separates high level players
