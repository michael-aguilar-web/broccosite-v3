# speed

## what separates noobs from pros in apex? 

if you've ever been unlucky enough to be matched against a highly skilled player as a noob, you probably have firsthand experience of what separates noobs from good players - chances are, you died extremely fast ðŸ™‚. If we compared players of each rank side by side, it would probably look something like this:

## so what does it mean to be a speedy apex player?

speed in apex can be simply defined as how fast a player is at performing an in game task:
- how fast can you wipe the other team in a fight?
- how fast can you get to a target after cracking them?
- how fast can you rotate to the spot you want?
- how fast can you loot?
- how fast can you ... ?

a player's **overall** skill is determined by how fast they are at all of the tasks in the game.

note how I don't define it only as how fast they can get **kills** - while grinding raw mechanics is one way to get better at the game, there are plenty of other skills that are **just as important** to improve upon.

another way of viewing speed is to look at **a player's ability to not waste time**; matches in apex legends have a fixed maximum match time of ~21 minutes, so every second counts. New players often spend a lot of time wandering aimlessly, both in and out of fights, whereas experienced players will be constantly making actions with intent. 

if you've never seen a pro speeding across the map before check out this guy:
