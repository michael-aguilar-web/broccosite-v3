# speed

_last updated: october 28, 2025 // first posted: march 5, 2023_

## what separates noobs from pros in apex? 

if you've ever been unlucky enough to be matched against a highly skilled player as a noob, you probably have firsthand experience of what separates noobs from good players - chances are, you died extremely fast ðŸ™‚. If we compared players of each rank side by side, it would probably look something like this:

## but why is speed so important?

all of the core skills in apex are related to speed in some way or another:
- how fast can you wipe the other team in a fight?
- how fast can you claim space from an opponent after cracking their shield?
- how fast can you rotate to the spot you want?
- how fast can you loot?
- how fast can you ... ?

a player's **overall** skill is often determined by how fast they are at all of the tasks in the game.

note how I don't define it only as how fast they can get **kills** - while grinding raw mechanics is one way to get better at the game, there are plenty of other skills that are **just as important** to improve upon.

another way of viewing speed is to look at **a player's ability to not waste time**; matches in apex legends have a fixed maximum match time of ~21 minutes, so every second counts. New players often spend a lot of time wandering aimlessly, both in and out of fights, whereas experienced players will be constantly making actions with intent. 

obviously, there's also a consistency factor (you can't just spam movement mechanics around really quickly and expect to win a 1v1), but for the most part, speed is a straightforward enough indicator of a player's overall skill.

if you've never seen a pro speeding across the map before check out this guy:

(definitely not a fanboy btw.)
