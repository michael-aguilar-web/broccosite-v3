# the basics

_last updated: march 5, 2023_

the following notes are written with the assumption you already have this knowledge:
- **gun knowledge:** what are all the guns and what ammo types do they use?
- **basic map knowledge:** knowing the general layout of a poi (point of interest), how to navigate a building without getting completely lost
- **legend knowledge:** what abilities does X legend have?

if you don't know these things already, you won't really learn too much from these notes. The good thing is though, this stuff is easy to learn and just requires putting in some time and not completely zoning out while playing.
