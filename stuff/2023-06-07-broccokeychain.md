# broccokeychain

_post date: june 7, 2023_

I needed to make something small to use up the last couple meters of green filament I had, so I made this today

solidworks was a terrible choice of software, I got baited by the terrible autotrace feature and it turned out to be something they developed a decade ago and then left on the side of the road to rot - it was comical how bad it was at tracing (so logically I just tossed that aside and did it manually)

the only reason I actually bothered to complete it in solidworks was because it seemed simple enough to trace manually, and I didn't want to learn a new software just for this 

also I'm a bezier curve enthusiast (definitely need to find a better choice of software for anything more complex in the future)
